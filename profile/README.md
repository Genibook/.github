##  What is it? 🤔

**This is an open-source project aiming to create a gradebook application built for Montgomery Highschool's gradebook system - Genesis!**

## How we built it 🛠

Eddie used python and go and flutter/dart.

The python was used in the backend, where webscraping and data processing took place, (now go)
while dart was used for the application building process.

## Why we built it 💭
Mainly, it is because the Genesis interface is a not-so-well-built website that was difficult to navigate.


However, Taking inspiration from [this application](https://github.com/gradebook-app) and the need for a gradebook application in his highschool,
the founder, [Eddie](https://github.com/EDED2314/), decided to create a website to do the same thing. 
This idea for a website turned into an idea for an application.
This application will achieve:
- Multiple Account Grade Viewing
- Working Schedule
- Report Card Viewing
- Multiple platform accessibility
- And More
